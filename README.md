# Requirements

###1. Optimization
  * Random sort
  * Greedy search
  * Simulated annealing
  * Requirements for Implementation
    * Implement the functionality described in the exercise – both greedy search and simulated annealing.
    * Be able to demonstrate the functionality by taking a new contribution function and optimize with respect to this.
    * Implement a demo mode that shows the development of the penalty for each iteration the same way as in figure 3 in the docs. Use matplotlib.

###2. Shortest Path and Traveling Salesman
  * About the data
  * Representation of the road info
  * Shortest path
  * Traveling salesman
  * Requirements for Implementation
    * Implement the reading of the XML file, where the information is represented with an undirected graph as described.
    * Implement the functionality described in the exercise - both the shortest path with Dijkstra's algorithm and the traveling salesman with the help of the optimization from part 1. 
    * Implementere funksjonaliteten beskrevet i oppgaven – b˚ade korteste vei med Djkstra’s algoritme og Travelling Salesman ved hjelp av optimaliseringen fra Del 1. You must implement this with your own data structures.
    * Be able to demonstrate the functionality by appending new waypoints for the shortest path and/or the traveling salesman problem.
